Some useful mappings & functions for OpenROAD programmers

1) Shortcut menus for methods, procedures & event blocks  - click on a method/procedure/event name & vim jumps to that section of code.
These functions were based on "incfiles.vim" by Thomas Ramming (much changed, I hasten to add - I have actually done some work here!)

2) Folding - text folds at BEGIN/END blocks - makes long files easier to navigate
  <F3> opens folds, <F4> closes. To turn off this feature, comment out the line "set foldmethod=marker"

3) Help on keywords - place cursor on an openroad keyword then shift-K opens the appropriate part of the openroad help file (need to use pre-4.1 MR help file)

4) command completion - type part of a word, press CTRL-space & Vim will guess the rest. I've taken this from "_vim_wok_visualcpp01.zip" by Wolfram Esser.

It's my first vim script, so I apologise if it seems crude
